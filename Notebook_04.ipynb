    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keypoints\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline consists of several stages: Data Collection, Text Cleaning, Preprocessing, Feature Extraction, Modeling, Evaluation, Deployment, and Maintenance and Monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text cleaning is crucial for improving model performance, efficiency, and accuracy by removing noise, inconsistencies, and irrelevant details from the text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Preprocessing includes tasks like tokenization (splitting text into words or phrases), stemming/lemmatization (reducing words to their base or root form), removing stop words (common words that don't carry much meaning), and case folding (converting text to lowercase).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature extraction transforms preprocessed text data into numerical formats using techniques like Bag-of-Words (BoW), which represents text by the frequency of words, and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), which adjusts the frequency of words by their rarity across documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The choice of preprocessing techniques can significantly impact the performance of machine learning models, especially in the context of deep learning. While traditional techniques like stemming and lemmatization are useful, they may not always improve performance in deep learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Managing vocabulary size is important to control model complexity and generalization. Strategies include limiting the vocabulary to the most frequent words and using subword tokenization to handle out-of-vocabulary words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understanding each step in the NLP pipeline is crucial for effective text data processing and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text cleaning is essential for removing dirty data and improving model performance. It involves handling noise, inconsistencies, and irrelevant information in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Preprocessing techniques like tokenization, stemming/lemmatization, stop word removal, and case folding prepare the text for feature extraction and modeling. They help in reducing dimensionality and focusing on meaningful information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature extraction methods like BoW and TF-IDF convert preprocessed text into numerical representations that machine learning models can understand and learn from.\n",
    "\n",
    "- While traditional NLP techniques such as stemming and lemmatization are useful, they may not always improve performance, especially in deep learning models. It's important to experiment and evaluate their impact on specific tasks and datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Managing vocabulary size is crucial for controlling model complexity and generalization. Techniques like limiting the vocabulary to frequent words and using subword tokenization help in handling large and evolving vocabularies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The distributional hypothesis, which states that words appearing in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings, is a fundamental concept in NLP that enables techniques like word embeddings to capture semantic relationships between words.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Experimenting with different preprocessing techniques, feature extraction methods, and vocabulary management strategies is essential to optimize the performance of NLP models for specific tasks and datasets."

    "# Understanding The Natural Language Processing (NLP) Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "The NLP pipeline is a series of structured steps that help transform raw text into a format that machines can understand and use to make decisions or predictions. Here we explore each step for a complete understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "Data collection is the first and crucial step in the pipeline, where we gather raw text data from various sources. The quality and quantity of this data can significantly impact the effectiveness of your NLP model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Text Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "In this stage, we clean the collected data by removing noise such as HTML tags, emojis, punctuation marks, etc., which do not contribute to understanding the actual content. This cleaned-up data will improve the model's performance and save computational resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing involves transformation to ready the data for feature extraction, including tasks like tokenization (splitting text into words or phrases), stemming/lemmatization (reducing words to their base/root form), and removing stop words (common words like 'is', 'an', 'the' that don't carry much meaning).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Feature Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "This stage involves converting preprocessed data into a format that can be understood by machine learning algorithms. Techniques like Bag-of-Words or TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) are employed here to create numerical representations of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "`We'll cover up to this point in this notebook. The remaining steps will be covered in the next notebook.`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the features are extracted and in proper format, we use them to build and train our NLP model. Depending on the end-goal, different models can be used, like Naive Bayes for classification, or LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) for sequence prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "After the model has been trained, it must be evaluated to ascertain its performance. Metrics like precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-score are typically considered. Also, the model might be tested with new data to validate its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "Once satisfied with the model's performance, the next step is to deploy it for practical use. This can range from integrating within an existing system or application, to deploying on a server for production use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Maintenance and Monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "Post-deployment, continuous monitoring is essential to ensure the model's performance doesn't degrade over time, due to changes in data patterns. Periodic retraining and tuning may be necessary to keep the model up-to-date."

    "For the purpose of this class, we won't be going through the data collection process. Instead, a carefully curated dataset is provided, tailored specifically for our needs. Here are some key details about it:\n",
    "\n",
    "## About The Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "- Custom tailored for this class from the [n2c2 NLP Researchh Data Sets](https://portal.dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/projects/n2c2-nlp/)\n",
    "- Around 1200 clinical notes from 1990-2006.\n",
    "- Subset from [Recognizing Obesity and Commorbities in Sparse Data](https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/16/4/561/766997)\n",
    "- I've used OpenAI API to translate it to Portuguese.\n",
    "- Data was anonymized by the original authors.\n",
    "- I've kept all artifacts, problems and errors from the original data set.\n",
    "> The drawn records were de-identified semi-automatically. An automatic pass, followed by two parallel manual passes were made over each record. These were followed by a third manual pass that resolved the disagreements between the two parallel manual passes. In order to make the data HIPAA compliant, patient names, health proxy and patient family member names, doctor names, hospital names, ID numbers, phone and pager numbers, dates, locations, ages, mentions of companies related to patient's occupations, some nationalities, and other potential identifiers were replaced with surrogates. The surrogate replacement process inserted random names from the US Census Bureau Database for each of the patient, health proxy, family member, and doctor names in the data. We made no effort to keep co-reference, though any name could have been drawn from the US Census Bureau Database more than once. For hospital names, ID numbers, phone and pager numbers, dates, locations, and ages, we generated surrogates randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data is in the `data` folder.\n",
    "- Despite the fact that the data is anonymized, I ask you to not share it outside this class.\n",

    "# Step 2 - Introduction to NLP and data cleaning: why should you clean your text?\n",
    "\n",
    "You cannot go straight from raw text to Ô¨Åtting a machine learning or deep learning model. Dirty or unorganized data can severely hinder your NLP projects, leading to inaccuracies and lower quality results. Hence, the importance of preprocessing and cleaning steps in NLP cannot be overstated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importance of Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Improving Model Performance**: Cleaned data improves algorithms' performances by reducing noise and irrelevant details in the dataset.\n",
    "2. **Efficiency**: It saves computing resources as the algorithms won't have to process irrelevant features or instances.\n",
    "3. **Accuracy**: Removing errors or discrepancies in your data reduces bias and improves the validity of your model's predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Problems in Text Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Noise\n",
    "Noise includes any unwanted components or errors within the text, such as HTML tags, punctuation marks, digits, etc., which do not contribute to the actual meaning of content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Inconsistencies\n",
    "Text data is often full of inconsistencies like spelling mistakes, acronyms, abbreviations, slang, and different languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. High Dimensionality\n",
    "Text data can become high-dimensional if not preprocessed correctly, especially when one-hot encoding techniques are applied. This can increase the computation complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Potential Consequences of Dirty Text Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decreased Performance**: Noise and irrelevant data can dilute important trends and patterns, degrading algorithm performance.\n",
    "- **Misinterpretation**: Inaccurate results due to poor data quality can lead to incorrect decisions or misinterpretations.\n",
    "- **Increased Complexity**: Unnecessary features or instances can increase the dimensionality of the dataset, resulting in higher computational costs.\n",

    "## A Broader Perspective on Text Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "While we've covered the fundamentals, text cleaning is a vast field with numerous complexities. Real-world projects often necessitate a more complete approach to text cleaning, as the data encountered is rarely as clean as what we've worked with so far. Here are some advanced considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Large-scale Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with large documents or numerous text files that exceed memory capacities, effective memory management techniques become essential. Strategies such as chunking, streaming, or distributed processing may need to be employed to efficiently handle the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extracting Text from Structured Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, you may need to extract text from structured document formats like HTML or PDFs. This presents unique challenges and requires specific parsing techniques to accurately extract the desired text while discarding the markup or formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Character Transliteration\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with non-English languages, transliterating characters into English can ease text processing. This involves converting characters from one script or alphabet to another while preserving the phonetic pronunciation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unicode Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Dealing with internationalized data often requires normalizing Unicode characters into a standardized form, such as UTF-8. This ensures consistent representation and helps avoid issues related to character encoding and compatibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Domain-Specific Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "Text from specific domains may contain unique words, phrases, or acronyms that add complexity to the cleaning process. Familiarity with the domain and its terminology is crucial for effectively handling and interpreting such text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Numeric Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Numbers, such as dates and amounts, require special attention. Depending on their relevance to the analysis, they may need to be processed in a specific manner or removed altogether. Consistent formatting and representation of numeric data are important considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error Correction\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying and correcting common typos and misspellings can significantly improve the quality of your data and lead to more accurate results. Techniques such as spell checking, dictionary-based correction, or even machine learning models can be employed for error correction.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Mojibake**: Mojibake refers to the garbled text that results from encoding and decoding issues, commonly encountered when dealing with text data from multiple sources. The [`ftfy` library](https://ftfy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is a Python tool specifically designed to fix mojibake and other Unicode-related issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Elusive Nature of 'Clean Text'\n",
    "\n",
    "Achieving truly clean text is an elusive goal, as the definition of 'clean' varies depending on the specific requirements of your project. The aim is to do the best we can given the available time, resources, and knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you progress through the text cleaning process, it's crucial to **continually review your tokens after each transformation**. Saving a new file after each transform allows for a thorough examination of your data in its altered state. Taking the time to review your data often leads to unexpected insights and a deeper understanding of its characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Remember, text cleaning is an iterative and ongoing process. There's always room for refinement, and each step brings you closer to cleaner, more analyzable text.*"

    "## Vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of **vocabulary** plays a significant role in text data processing and machine learning. In this context, vocabulary refers to the set of unique words that exist in a corpus, or collection of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Importance of Vocabulary Size\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vocabulary size** can be regarded as a hyperparameter of the model.\n",
    "2. An important point to note here is that a larger vocabulary would allow the model to have more features implying more available information about the input data.\n",
    "3. Conversely, a larger vocabulary implies that the vector representation of the text will be larger too, slowing down the training process of the model and making it prone to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualizing the Extremes\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's visualize how the extremes look:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Using Letters as Tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "* The first extreme approach to defining your vocabulary would be using individual letters as tokens.\n",
    "* Although this results in a very small vocabulary, each word gets represented by a considerably large feature vector, equal to the number of unique letters, 26 for English for instance.\n",
    "* Note that this approach leads to a very sparse matrix. This means most of its entries are zeros.\n",
    "* Training a model with such sparse representation could severely slow down the training process.\n",
    "* Each document would be represented by a vector of length 26, with each entry representing the frequency of the corresponding letter in the document. That, however, would be a very inefficient representation, as we'd quickly lose signal about the actual words in the document. Representing entire documents would result in all signal turning into noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Using Words as Unrestricted Tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "* Moving to the other extreme, if we use every unique word as a token without any restriction on the vocabulary size, we'll encounter different issues.\n",
    "* As can be anticipated, the vocabulary size would grow exponentially, triggering a huge, sparse feature vector for each document.\n",
    "* The downsides similar to the previous extreme ‚Äî a slowed training process, increased overfitting likelihood.\n",
    "* In addition, the resulting vocab would be technically infinite, as new words are constantly being added to the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Striking the Balance: Fixed Vocabulary Size\n",
    "\n",
    "What we ideally seek is an equilibrium. A spot between these two extremes that best serves our purpose. A key strategy to achieve this balance is fixing the vocabulary size:\n",
    "\n",
    "* By fixing the vocabulary size, we'd only consider the top 'N' frequently occurring words in the entire corpus.\n",
    "* This ensures the vocabulary size remains 'N', with each word or document being represented by a vector of length 'N'.\n",
    "* Such a setup offers a more reasonable, dense representation (opposite of sparse), and significantly speeding up model training compared to the previously explained extreme strategies.\n",
    "* This however involves trade-offs ‚Äî less frequent, potentially significant words might get left out.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Manipulating the size of the vocabulary allows us to control the complexity of our model and its ability to generalize from the training data to unseen data. Therefore, it's vital to choose your strategy wisely based on your specific requirements and constraints.\n",

    "### Curiosity: Zipf's Law\n",
    "\n",
    "Zipf's law is a renowned empirical rule connected with the fields of linguistics, information theory and statistics. This empirical principle claims that the frequency of any particular word in a corpus (a large and structured set of texts) of language is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table.\n",
    "\n",
    "This principle was first formulated by George Kingsley Zipf, an American linguist, back in 1935. He originally focused on quantitative linguistics, stating that within any natural language corpus, the rate of any word is inversely correlated to its ranking position in the frequency index.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does this actually mean? Simply put, within a text or collection of text, the most commonly occurring word will appear approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word, thrice as often as the third recurring word, and so on. In reality, if you were to list all the words from a text in order of how often they occur, you would see this pattern emerge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The application of Zipf's law doesn't end at words; it extends to letters too. The pattern repeats itself ‚Äì the most common letter in the English language, \"e\", appears approximately twice as often as the second most common letter, \"t\", and thrice as often as the third most common letter, \"a\", and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, Zipf's law can also apply beyond linguistic contexts. It can describe a range of phenomena that exhibit similar patterns of frequency relative to rank. It can depict the population rank distribution of cities (i.e., the largest city is twice as populous as the second-largest city), viewing rates for TV channels, incoming calls at call centers or even the number of Internet links pointing towards each individual webpage on the World Wide Web.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, Zipf's law presents us with a fascinating insight into patterns of repetition and prevalence found amongst elements within a given system - be it words, cities, calls or webpages.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Let's check if that applies to our dataset. We'll use the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each word in our dataset."

    "### N-Grams\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, an N-gram is a sequence that contains up to 'n' number of elements which have been extracted from a larger sequence. These elements could extend across a wide range from characters, syllables, words and even symbols like ‚ÄúA,‚Äù ‚ÄúT,‚Äù ‚ÄúG,‚Äù and ‚ÄúC‚Äù in DNA sequencing. For our discussion, we'll focus on words as the primary elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of language sequences and linguistic patterns, these 'n' elements usually refer to words. They could be single words (unigrams), two-word sequences (bigrams), three-word sequences (trigrams), and so on. The term extends to identify longer sequences by the numeric value of 'n', such as four-gram, five-gram, and beyond!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applications of N-Grams\n",
    "\n",
    "The application of n-grams is extensive; it spans from statistical natural language processing to genetic sequence analysis. However, it's important to note that the n-grams don't inherently carry any special significance - they are merely sequences of 'n' words which commonly appear together within a text.\n",
    "\n",
    "To draw an illustration, consider this sentence: \"Eu gosto muito de estudar PLN.\" Here, we can identify these bigrams: \"Eu gosto\", \"gosto muito\", \"muito de\", \"de estudar\", \"estudar PLN\". Additionally, the trigrams within the given sentence would be: \"Eu gosto muito\", \"gosto muito de\", \"muito de estudar\", \"de estudar PLN\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Importance of N-Grams\n",
    "\n",
    "So, why should we regard n-grams important?\n",
    "\n",
    "When we break down a sequence of tokens into individual words or what we call a bag-of-words vector, we tend to lose much of the innate meaning carried through their order and combination. By recognizing these multiword tokens, i.e., n-grams within our pipeline, we allow our NLP model to retain the semantic structure built-in to word order in sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, take the word ‚Äún√£o\". Without considering n-grams, this word could end up floating around freely, attaching its negative connotation to the entire sentence or document, rather than specifically to its neighboring words. If we recognize \"n√£o gostou\" as a 2-gram, we retain more of the original intent behind the phrase than we would by treating \"n√£o\" and \"gostou\" as isolated 1-grams in a bag-of-words vector. This approach keeps a part of the context of a word intact by associating it with its neighbours within our pipeline.\n",

    "### Case folding\n",
    "Case folding, also known as case normalization, is the process wherein we consolidate different \"spellings\" of a word that differ only in their capitalization. Words often become case \"denormalized\" when they are capitalized at the beginning of a sentence or emphasized through upper-case spelling. The purpose of this process is to standardize words that essentially mean the same thing but appear differently due to varied capitalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Importance of Case Folding\n",
    "\n",
    "Case folding, while seemingly simple, plays a crucial role in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It helps to reduce your vocabulary size and streamline your NLP pipeline by consolidating words with equivalent meanings and spells under a single token.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, 'doctor' and 'Doctor' - though meaning the same - may be treated as different words because of the difference in capitalization. While the lower-case variant could indicate a medical professional, the capitalized form might usually refer to a title or an individual's name. Being able to distinguish between the two can be important if recognizing proper nouns is crucial to your NLP task.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if tokens aren't normalized for case, your vocabulary might expand approximately twice as large, consuming double the memory and processing time. This might also increase the amount of training data you need to label for your machine learning pipeline to converge onto an accurate solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Balancing Efficiency and Information Content\n",
    "\n",
    "Though case folding can streamline your NLP pipeline, it's essential to strike a balance between computational efficiency and information content.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many situations, the efficiency gained through reducing vocabulary size by half might be outweighed by the loss of valuable information specific to proper nouns. Nevertheless, some information may inadvertently get lost even without case normalization. For example, if the word \"The\" at the beginning of a sentence isn't identified as a stop word, it could impair certain applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sophisticated pipelines usually perform selective case normalization, identifying proper nouns first before normalizing case for other words at the start of sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Choosing the Right Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach to case normalization largely depends on the specifics of your application and the nature of your corpus. If similar terms like ‚ÄúSmith's‚Äù and ‚Äúwordsmiths‚Äù aren't crucial to your analysis, you could simply convert all words to lowercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the most effective strategy typically involves experimenting with multiple approaches and choosing the one which optimizes the performance of your NLP project. There's no one-size-fits-all solution ‚Äì the best method would be the one that aligns perfectly with your project objectives.\n",

    "### Another approach: Subword tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "Subword tokenization is an advanced technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that offers a powerful approach to handling challenges such as Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) words, reducing vocabulary size, and capturing finer-grained morphological and semantic information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantageous Aspects\n",
    "\n",
    "Some major advantages of subword tokenization include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Handling OOV Words**: Subword tokenization allows your model to handle words it has not previously encountered. Even if the model hasn't seen a particular word during training, it can correctly process it if it recognizes the subwords or word-parts that make up the word.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reducing Vocabulary Size**: With subword tokenization, we break down words into smaller units, leading to a reduction in the overall size of the vocabulary. This can lead to lower memory usage and faster processing times.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Capturing Morphological Information**: Subword tokenization carries the potential to capture meaningful lingual fragments and provide insights into the morphological structure of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's important to recognize that subword tokenization also introduces its own set of challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenges with Subword Tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "One critical challenge of using subword tokenization is that it adds a layer of complexity to the tokenization process. Additionally, the interpretability and explainability of the model's output might be compromised. The reason for this trade-off lies in the nature of subword units themselves: they aren't actual 'words' in the strictest sense and hence, the model could struggle to establish context or derive meaning from these tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Subword tokenization is a crucial component of state-of-the-art models like transformers. We'll see how and why the usage of subword tokenization enhances the performance of these models in an upcoming lecture.\n",

    "## Stop words\n",
    "\n",
    "Stop words hold a significant position in the world of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR). But what exactly are stop words?\n",
    "\n",
    "As per the [Introduction to Information Retrieval](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/dropping-common-terms-stop-words-1.html):\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Stop words are extremely common words that appear to have little value in helping select documents matching a user's need. As a result, they are excluded from the vocabulary entirely.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Stop words are words which are filtered out before or after processing of natural language data (text). Though \"stop words\" usually refers to the most common words in a language, there is no single universal list of stop words used by all natural language processing tools, and indeed not all tools even use such a list. Some tools specifically avoid removing these stop words to support phrase search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, the use of stop words has seen a remarkable evolution over time in the field of Information Retrieval (IR). In the early systems, it was a common practice to maintain large stop lists, typically including around 200-300 terms. The main purpose was to filter out these frequently occurring words, with the idea that their exclusion would help streamline and improve the search process.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as IR systems have advanced, there has been a noticeable shift toward the usage of significantly smaller stop lists, containing just about 7-12 terms. This change mainly stemmed from the understanding that several common words, earlier perceived as insignificant, might carry valuable context or sentiment information which could enhance search accuracy and result relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the latest trend in especially web search engines, is not using any stop list at all. These modern platforms now prefer keeping these so-called 'insignificant' words in their vocabulary, realizing that every word, regardless of how common, can potentially provide crucial information that aids in better matching with the user needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The theory and practice surrounding stop words is a prime example of how our understanding and handling of text data evolves as we develop more sophisticated tools and techniques. It highlights the importance of continual learning and adaptation in the ever-changing landscape of Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing."

It is highly opinionated, meaning that it typically offers one single, but exceptionally optimized way to achieve a task. This design philosophy contrasts with other libraries such as NLTK, which offer numerous methods for each task, yet often lack the same level of optimization which Spacy provides.

    "### Analyzing Word Forms: Stemming and Lemmatization\n",
    "\n",
    "In linguistics, analyzing different word forms to dig into their base form or root is often crucial. The goal is to understand the patterns of a language, its semantics, morphology, and syntax. Let's consider this using some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Set of Words for Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following sets of words:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *organizar, organiza, e organizamos*\n",
    "2. *belos, belas, e bela*\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that these words share a same root but appear in various forms due to changes in tense, number, mode, etc. So, how do we determine if they are essentially the 'same'?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer that, we will check two techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP): **Stemming** and **Lemmatization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding Stemming\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stemming** is a technique used in NLP to break down a word into its base or stem form. It does so by chopping off affixes such as plural markers, tense markers, or derivational suffixes from a word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take for example, the set of words : *organizar, organiza, e organizamos*. After applying stemming, we can reduce these derivatives to their base form ‚Üí 'organiz'.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the stemming approach may not always lead to actual words present in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding Lemmatization\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, **Lemmatization** takes into account the complete morphological analysis of the word before reducing it to its base or dictionary form (lemma). This is done keeping the context of the word in mind which helps in achieving meaningful results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the set: *organizar, organiza, e organizamos*. These words after being subjected to lemmatization would all come down to ‚Üí 'organizar'.\n",
    "\n",
    "> While both stemming and lemmatization aim to produce the root form of words, lemmatization tends to be more accurate at the cost of speed, whereas stemming is quicker but may result in non-word tokens. Unlike stemming, lemmatization ensures that the root word belongs to the language which leverages understanding of the context. For this reason, Spacy doesn't include a stemmer, but it does provide a lemmatizer.\n"

    "- After stemming, the words 'medicamento', 'medicinal', and 'medicina' would all be reduced to 'medic'.\n",

    "### Word Representations in Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), one of the key problems to solve is how to represent words in a way that computers can understand and process. There are two main approaches for this: the **localist approach** and the **distributed approach**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Localist Approach: Words as Discrete Symbols\n",
    "\n",
    "In the localist approach, which is used traditionally in NLP, each word in a language is considered as a distinct entity or a discrete symbol. One common representation technique here involves the use of 'one-hot vectors'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a vocabulary of 10,000 unique words. Each word would be represented by a vector of length 10,000. This vector is filled with zeros except for one position - the unique index representing the specific word - which is set to one. Hence, the term 'one-hot'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although straightforward, the localist method has limitations, particularly when it comes to capturing semantic relationships between words, i.e., how closely related the meanings of different words are. This limitation leads us to the second approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Distributed Approach: Continuous Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to seeing words as individual symbols, the distributed approach treats words as continuous vectors in high-dimensional space. Under this model, each word is portrayed as a point within this space. The intriguing part is that words sharing similar semantic attributes tend to cluster close to each other within this space.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique makes use of **word embeddings**, where every word is mapped to a dense vector that represents its context in the high-dimensional space. Consequently, even if we come across an unfamiliar word, we can infer some properties about it based on its proximity to known words.\n",
    "\n",
    "The major strength of the distributed approach lies in its ability to generalize from known to unknown, based on semantic similarity, providing richer and more powerful representations of words.\n",

The inverse document frequency is calculated as the logarithm of the ratio of the total number of documents in the set, represented by capital $N$, divided by the number of documents containing the term $t$, denoted by lowercase $n$ subscript $t$. In this formula, $d$ represents a document that belongs to the document set $D$, and $t$ represents a term that belongs to the document $d$.

    "Both approaches above are referred to as **Bag-of-words** (BoW) models. Its name comes from their unique process of disregarding the order and sequencing of words in any given text, are a foundational concept in natural language processing. Rather than focusing on linguistic sequencing or contextual considerations, these models consider every word in isolation, tallying up the frequency of each term within the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, these models also bear the label of **localist** models. This refers to their emphasis on the local, individual context of each word, as opposed to considering the overall global context of the sentence or paragraph in which they're found.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of the Bag-of-Words Model\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Effective Simplicity\n",
    "These models may be simple, but don't let that fool you ‚Äî their performance can be surprisingly impressive. For fundamental tasks, a BoW model serves as a robust starting point likely to yield satisfactory outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Quick Processing\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 3. Easy to Grasp\n",
    "The simplicity of BoW models makes them easy to comprehend and explain‚Äîa critical aspect for natural language processing (NLP) models. This is especially true in legal domains where detailed jargon needs to be broken down efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Straightforward Implementation\n",
    "Developing a BoW model doesn't require extensive programming knowledge or complicated algorithms. They can be implemented easily thanks to their straightforward design.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages of the Bag-of-words Model\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Lack of Sequence Information\n",
    "A key downside to the BoW model is its inability to account for word sequencing‚Äîan essential aspect of human language.\n",
    "> As an example, consider the Portuguese sentences \"Ele foi considerado culpado, n√£o inocente\" and \"Ele foi considerado inocente, n√£o culpado\". These two hold entirely different meanings, but the discrepancy would remain undetected by a BoW model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. No Semantic Understanding\n",
    "These models are not capable of grasping the complex semantics or meanings behind words, limiting their applicability in more nuanced linguistic tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Sparse Representations\n",
    "The vector representations produced by these models often contain numerous zeros, leading to inefficient resource usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Large Vector Dimension\n",
    "In the BoW model, the dimension of the vector equates to the size of the vocabulary used. Consequently, for large language data sets, vector dimensions can become unwieldly large, posing computational challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Limited Word Similarity Detection\n",
    "BoW models use one-hot vectors, which invariably fail to reflect similarities between words. For example, in Portuguese, \"azul\" (blue) and \"anil\" (indigo) are semantically related, but as far as a BoW model is concerned, these words are as distinct as \"azul\" and \"sol\" (sun).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Difficulties with Unknown Words\n",
    "Representing words not included in the initial vocabulary is challenging. For instance, consider a word like \"COVID\", which was virtually non-existent before 2019‚Äîhow might a BoW model trained prior to that year represent this term?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Did you know? The BoW model remains a popular choice for text classification tasks, such as sentiment analysis, spam detection, and topic classification. It works unreally well for these tasks because it doesn't require a deep understanding of the text's meaning. Instead, it focuses on the frequency of words, which is often sufficient for these tasks.\n",
    "> However, for more complex tasks, such as machine translation, the BoW model is not a viable option. So, what can we do to overcome these limitations? The answer lies in the **Word Embedding** model."

    "`Answers are commented inside this cell`\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- 1. The main stages of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline discussed in the class are Data Collection, Text Cleaning, Preprocessing, Feature Extraction, Modeling, Evaluation, Deployment, and Maintenance and Monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Text cleaning is crucial in the NLP pipeline because it improves model performance, efficiency, and accuracy by removing noise and irrelevant details from the dataset. This ensures that the algorithms process only meaningful and relevant data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Three common text preprocessing techniques are tokenization, stemming/lemmatization, and removing stop words. Tokenization involves splitting text into words or phrases. Stemming and lemmatization reduce words to their base or root forms. Removing stop words eliminates common words like 'is', 'an', 'the' that do not carry significant meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The purpose of feature extraction in NLP is to transform text data into numerical formats that machine learning algorithms can understand. The methods covered in the class include Bag-of-Words (BoW), which represents text by the frequency of words, and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), which adjusts the frequency of words by how commonly they appear across documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The choice of preprocessing techniques can significantly impact the performance of machine learning models. Proper preprocessing can enhance model accuracy and efficiency by ensuring that only relevant and clean data is used. Conversely, poor preprocessing can introduce noise and irrelevant data, degrading model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Managing vocabulary size is important because a larger vocabulary can lead to higher dimensionality and computational complexity. Strategies mentioned in the class include limiting the vocabulary to the top 'N' most frequent words and using subword tokenization to handle out-of-vocabulary words and reduce vocabulary size.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The distributional hypothesis suggests that words appearing in similar contexts have similar meanings. This hypothesis is significant because it allows us to understand the meaning of words based on their context, which is the foundation for techniques like word embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Stop words are common words that are filtered out before or after processing natural language data. Their usage affects NLP tasks by reducing the dimensionality of the data and focusing on more meaningful words, which can improve the efficiency and performance of the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Stemming reduces words to their base form by removing affixes, often resulting in non-dictionary words (e.g., \"running\" to \"run\"). Lemmatization reduces words to their base or dictionary form, considering the context (e.g., \"running\" to \"run\"). Lemmatization is often preferred over stemming in scenarios where the meaning and context of words are important, as it provides more accurate and meaningful roots.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Word embeddings offer several advantages over traditional Bag-of-Words models. Embeddings capture the semantic relationships between words, allowing similar words to have similar vector representations. Unlike BoW, which results in sparse vectors, embeddings provide dense vectors that are computationally efficient. Embeddings consider the context in which words appear, leading to better performance in tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. Embeddings can also generalize to new words based on their context, overcoming the limitations of BoW models. -->"
