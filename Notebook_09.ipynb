    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keypoints\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) process sequential data by maintaining hidden states across time steps, allowing them to capture dependencies and relationships between words in a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- RNNs face challenges with vanishing and exploding gradients when dealing with long sequences. The vanishing gradient problem occurs when gradients become extremely small during backpropagation, preventing effective learning. The exploding gradient problem happens when gradients become very large, leading to unstable training.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks address the limitations of RNNs by introducing a memory cell and gates (input, output, forget) that regulate information flow. This allows LSTMs to effectively capture long-term dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The LSTM architecture consists of an input gate that controls what new information is added to the cell state, a forget gate that determines what information to discard, an output gate that decides what information from the cell state is used to compute the hidden state, and a memory cell that maintains long-term information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bidirectional LSTM networks process sequences in both forward and backward directions, capturing both past and future contexts. This additional context helps improve the performance of sequence processing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) simplify the LSTM architecture by combining the hidden and cell states into a single hidden state and using only two gates (update and reset). GRUs are computationally more efficient than LSTMs while still effectively handling long-term dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The case study demonstrated the application of RNN, LSTM, and GRU architectures on a name gender classification task using a dataset from the 2010 Brazilian Census. The Bidirectional LSTM achieved the highest accuracy, followed by the Bidirectional GRU, LSTM, and Vanilla RNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understanding RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs is crucial for natural language processing tasks that involve sequential data and require capturing dependencies over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The choice of architecture depends on the specific task and its complexity. RNNs can suffice for simpler, short-term dependencies, while LSTMs and GRUs are better suited for more complex tasks or longer sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bidirectional networks offer additional context by processing sequences in both forward and backward directions, leading to improved performance in sequence processing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Experimenting with different architectures, hyperparameters, and iterative model evaluation is essential to find the optimal solution for a given task.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Comprehending the strengths and limitations of each architecture and considering the tradeoffs between model complexity, computational efficiency, and performance is crucial when selecting the appropriate model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mastering these foundational concepts and techniques provides a strong basis for advancing skills in natural language processing and tackling more complex tasks such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, and text generation."

    "> Side Note: This class contains a set of very vanilla implementations with tools that we don't usually use in production. For example, we use the `torchtext` library to load the dataset and create the vocabulary. In a real-world scenario, we would use a more efficient and scalable approach, such as tokenization with `transformers` or `spaCy` and data loading with `DataLoader` from PyTorch. Please bear in mind that the goal of this class is to provide a basic understanding of RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs, not to showcase the most efficient implementation."

    "When processing textual data, it's crucial to consider the dependencies and relationships between words in a sentence. The semantics of a sentence can change profoundly based on the order and selection of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider these two similar sentences:\n",
    "> \"A bomba explodiu no jornal.\"\n",
    ">\n",
    "> \"A notícia do jornal explodiu como uma bomba\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite having analogous structure, interchanging just one adjective leads to a completely different meaning and emotional impact on the reader. Context plays a vital role, especially when a sentence's overall meaning can be greatly influenced by what has been said or happened previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Recurrent Neural Networks* (RNNs) provide neural networks with the capability to memorize previous words within a statement, enabling them to better capture and understand patterns that appear when certain tokens appear sequentially relative to other tokens. This is the fundamental premise of RNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How RNNs Maintain State Across Time\n",
    "\n",
    "RNNs operate on the principle of maintaining state across time. While initially, it might seem complicated, it's essentially about giving the network a context for its current operation based on historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each input fed into a standard feed-forward network, the output from one time step 't' is provided as an additional input for the next step 't+1', along with the fresh data being supplied at 't+1'. In simpler terms, you inform the network about what happened earlier alongside what is happening \"now\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This concept forms the basis of RNNs—which learn and remember over time, enabling them to better capture patterns within sequences. Understanding this is key to exploiting the power of RNNs for text analysis and other sequential data processing tasks."

    "## Visualizing a RNN\n",
    "\n",
    "You can visualize a recurrent net as shown in figure below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"images/rnn_unrolled.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 50%; height: 50%\"/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at the left side. The circles are entire feedforward network layers composed of one or more neurons. The output of the hidden layer emerges from the network as normal, but it’s also set aside to be passed back in as an input to itself along with the normal input from the next time step. This feedback is represented with an arc from the output of a layer back into its own input.\n",
    "\n",
    "An easier way to see this process—and it’s more commonly shown this way—is by unrolling the net. The right side of the image above shows the network stood on its head with two unfoldings of the time variable (t), showing layers for t+1 and t+2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time step is represented by a column of neurons in the unrolled version of the very same neural network. It’s like looking at a screenplay or video frame of the neural net for each sample in time. The network to the right is the future version of the network on the left. The output of a hidden layer at one time step (t) is fed back into the hidden layer along with input data for the next time step (t+1) to the right. Repeat. This diagram shows two iterations of this unfolding, so three columns of neurons for t=0, t=1, and t=2.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the vertical paths in this visualization are clones, or views of the same neurons. They are the single network represented on a timeline. This visualization is helpful when talking about how information flows through the network forward and backward during backpropagation. But when looking at the three unfolded networks, remember that they’re all different snapshots of the same network with a single set of weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of RNN: Feedforward Network Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "Viewing the left side of the image above, you'll notice circles that represent layers in a feedforward network, with each layer comprising one or more neurons. The output of the hidden layer not only moves forward through the network but also feeds back into the input of its originating layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This recurrent feedback is illustrated by an arc looping from the layer's output back to its own input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unfolding Time Variable for Better Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "To better visualize this process, we can 'unroll' the network over time. This technique, represented on the right side of the image, essentially flips the network on its head, revealing the progress of the network over two stages of the time variable (t), namely t+1 and t+2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time step 't' is denoted as a column of neurons in the unrolled version of our network. It can be thought of as watching successive frames of a movie, where each frame represents the state of the network at a given moment in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cloned Views of Same Neurons\n",
    "\n",
    "In this representation, all vertical paths are clones or different views of the same set of neurons; they depict the same neural network captured at various points along a timeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this kind of representation simplifies comprehension of information flow (both forward and backward during backpropagation), it's essential to remember when looking at these multiple 'unfolded' networks: they are merely simultaneous snapshots of the same single network maintaining a consistent set of weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Recognizing an unrolled RNN as sequential instances of the same network operating over time is crucial for understanding how RNNs capture and utilize temporal information from sequences. This comprehension forms the basis of effectively utilizing the power of RNNs for sequence data processing tasks."

    "### Our case study\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's discuss an interesting scenario. Assume you are employed at the Ombudsman Office of our University. A major part of your role involves addressing students' complaints and correspondingly communicating with the related departments. As a measure to enhance the quality of your communication, you have decided to use gender-appropriate pronouns based on the person's first name.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important goal is to avoid incorrectly gendering specific roles or offices within the university (e.g., naming the President's office as \"Gabinete do Reitor\" even when the President is a female, which happened between 2011 and 2019 at UFRN).\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this objective, we will be using a [dataset collected by IBGE during 2010 Census](https://brasil.io/dataset/genero-nomes/nomes/). This dataset contains a total of 90,104 names, out of which 49,274 are female and 40,830 are male. To ensure accuracy, any names that could be associated with both genders, such as \"Elias\", \"Ivani\" or \"Alison\", have been excluded from our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Interestingly, during my data exploration, I found out that there were 189,315 men and 1,387 women with the same name as mine. I'd never imagine women could be named Elias!\n",
    "\n",
    "Our aim here is to develop a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that can read a name letter by letter, and predict the probability of the name being either masculine or feminine. For the purpose of this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each lowercase letter will be considered a token\n",
    "- The vocabulary will comprise the 26 alphabet letters\n",
    "- Any accented letters will be converted to their non-accented versions\n",
    "\n",
    "We will divide our dataset into two parts: 80% for training and 20% for validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Please note that while we recognize and respect the existence of non-binary gender identities, for the purposes of this exercise, we will be employing a binary classification model due to dataset limitations. Our dataset solely contains names which are classified as either masculine or feminine, hence we are confined to two classes. Maybe in the future we can work on a more inclusive model!"

    "In our example, we've selected an arbitrary hidden size of 50 and an embedding dimension of 25. These choices were made largely to minimize computation time; however, adjusting these parameters can yield different results in both computational speed and model accuracy. Hence, it's encouraged that you experiment with varying these numbers based on your specific use-cases.\n",

    "#### Rule of Thumb for Model Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "A helpful guiding principle when designing models is to ensure that the complexity of your model aligns appropriately with your data's innate structure. The objective is to achieve a balance where:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Your model isn't too complex for your data (Overfitting), and\n",
    "2. It's not too simple relative to your data (Underfitting).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's understand what this means:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Overfitting - High Variance and Low Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "When a model is overly complex, it tends to \"memorize\" the training data rather than \"learning\" from it, causing poor generalization when faced with new, unseen data. This scenario is referred to as **overfitting** the data and results in a model with high variance and low bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Underfitting - Low Variance and High Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, if a model is too uncomplicated, it will fail even in capturing the fundamental patterns of the training data. Such underutilizing models are prone to consistently generate inaccurate predictions across all data types, both seen and unseen. This sub-optimal situation is known as **underfitting** and leads to a model with low variance and high bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Balancing Between Bias and Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "Balancing between overfitting and underfitting is often described as managing the trade-off between bias and variance. The key is to find a sweet spot where the model is just complex enough to learn useful patterns from the training data but also retains the ability to generalize effectively to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "While building your model, it's essential to keep this concept in mind: experiment with different parameters, monitor how they affect the performance of your model, and fine-tune them for optimal results."

Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",

    "# Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Networks: A Thorough Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get into the fascinating world of LSTM Networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Identifying the Dilemma: Dealing with Long-Term Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "In our earlier cells, we examined how Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) utilize the concept of state retention over successive time periods to process sequential data. Nevertheless, RNNs often encounter challenges while dealing with long-term dependencies due to complex problems such as the 'vanishing gradient'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unfolding the Vanishing Gradient Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The vanishing gradient problem is a troublesome circumstance where the gradients (derivatives) of the loss function, associated with the parameters (weights and biases) of the neural network, start reducing exponentially as the number of layers in the network increases. This issue becomes particularly prevalent in RNNs because calculating the gradient involves a method known as 'backpropagation through time'.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Backpropagation is an algorithmic methodology used for training neural networks. It modifies the weights of the network in alignment with the direction of the loss function's gradient until this loss function has been minimized as much as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The root cause behind the vanishing gradient problem rests within the repeated multiplication of gradients through the chain of network layers. As the backpropagation process occurs, the gradient, while being propagated backward through time, is continuously multiplied by the weight matrix from each successive layer. If these weights are smaller than 1, an exponential decrease can be observed in the gradient as it passes through the network, leading to a 'vanish' or near-zero gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decoding the Exploding Gradient Phenomenon\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other side of the spectrum from the vanishing gradient, we find the exploding gradient problem. This situation arises when the gradient of the loss function, relative to the network parameters, begins to increase exponentially with the growing number of layers. Just like its counterpart, this problem is quite common in RNNs, given that the gradient computation involves backpropagation through time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The root cause of the exploding gradient problem mirrors its vanishing equivalent — it's also linked to the continuous multiplication of gradients across the network layers. Here, if the weight matrix is larger than 1, the gradient may inflate exponentially as it traverses back through the network during backpropagation, leading to an 'exploding' or excessively large gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clarifying the Concept of Long-Term Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "These challenging vanishing and exploding gradient issues present notable obstacles for RNNs aiming to capture long-term dependencies. Long-term dependencies are inter-relationships between elements in a sequence that are separated by substantial distances. Let's consider the following sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"O cachorro passou o dia brincando .......... estava cansado.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the word \"estava\" relies on the word \"cachorro\", even though they are significantly apart in the sentence. Unfortunately, due to the vanishing and exploding gradient problems, RNNs often fail to effectively capture these kinds of long-term dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks come into play. Being a special type of RNN, LSTM networks are adept at successfully capturing long-term dependencies. This unique capability can be traced back to [the introduction of LSTM networks in 1997 by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber](https://www.bioinf.jku.at/publications/older/2604.pdf). Since then, they have found widespread use across diverse areas such as speech recognition, language modeling, and machine translation."

    "The input gate regulates the inflow of information from the input layer to the cell. It consists of a sigmoid activation layer adjoined by a pointwise multiplication operation. The sigmoid function returns values between zero and one, which are multiplied with the network's input. If the sigmoid function outputs a zero, it blocks all incoming information. In contrast, an output of one allows all information to enter the cell. Thus, the input gate acts as a guard, protecting the cell from irrelevant or noise data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for the input gate is:\n",
    "$$ i_t = \\sigma(W_i \\cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Components:**\n",
    "- $ i_t $: input vector at time $ t $.\n",
    "- $ \\sigma $: sigmoid function, which limits values between 0 and 1.\n",
    "- $ W_i $: weight matrix for the input gate.\n",
    "- $ h_{t-1} $: hidden state of the cell at time $ t-1 $.\n",
    "- $ x_t $: input at time $ t $.\n",
    "- $ b_i $: bias vector for the input gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function:**\n",
    "- This gate decides which new information will be stored in the cell state. The sigmoid function produces a vector of values between 0 and 1, where values close to 0 indicate ignoring and values close to 1 indicate storing the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Output Gate\n",
    "\n",
    "Like its input counterpart, the output gate controls the flow of information but from the cell to the hidden state, also comprising a sigmoid activation layer and a pointwise multiplication operation. The output gate uses the returned value from the sigmoid function (between zero and one) to regulate the amount of information flowing to the hidden state—zero halts all information flow, while one permits full information transfer. This mechanism enables the output gate to secure the hidden state from receiving any unnecessary or misleading information.\n",

    "- $ b_o $: bias vector for the output gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function:**\n",
    "- This gate decides which information from the cell state will be used to compute the next hidden state.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Forget Gate\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the forget gate manages how much information should be discarded from the cell. It comprises a sigmoid activation layer and pointwise multiplication operation. Here, the numbers generated by the sigmoid function, ranging from zero to one, decide how much information from the cell state should be kept, with zero forgetting all information and one maintaining all information. This forget gate acts as a protective barrier, helping the cell dispose of any outdated or irrelevant information that could potentially hamper the overall learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for the forget gate is: $$ f_t = \\sigma(W_f \\cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f) $$\n",

    "## Bidirectional Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous sections, we established how LSTM networks effectively capture long-term dependencies. Nonetheless, traditional LSTM networks possess one built-in limitation - they are unidirectional, meaning they only consider past information while making predictions about the future. This quality is valuable in numerous instances, but may not suffice in certain scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the sentence in Portuguese:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"O cachorro passou o dia brincando .......... estava cansado.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, the word \"estava\" (was) depends on both the preceding word \"cachorro\" (dog), as well as the subsequent word \"cansado\" (tired). Given that a standard LSTM network only takes past information into account, it would struggle to capture the long-term dependency between \"estava\" and \"cansado\".\n",
    "\n",
    "To circumvent this issue, we introduce a specialized type of architecture called a bidirectional LSTM network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Bidirectional LSTM Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "A bidirectional LSTM network comprises two separate LSTM layers, each processing data sequences in opposing directions—one from the past towards the future, and the other from the future backwards to the past. The outputs from these two LSTM layers are then amalgamated to generate the final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"images/bidirectional_lstm.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 50%; height: 50%\"/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "While we have been focusing on LSTM networks, it's important to clarify that bidirectionality is not exclusive to LSTMs. In fact, all types of recurrent networks can be configured to work in a bidirectional manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comprehending the Dual Processing Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "A bidirectional network can be visualized as two distinct networks operating concurrently, each processing sequences in different directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "One part of the network processes sequences from the past to the future, thus capturing the past dependencies just like a regular LSTM. This 'forward' layer scans the input sequence in the natural order, from the first element to the last, unearthing any dependencies that look ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other part, a 'backward' layer, processes sequences from future to past, enabling it to take future information into account. In essence, this layer reads the input sequence backwards, starting from the last element and moving to the first one, capturing dependencies that look backward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon completion of processing, the outputs from these two parts of the network are combined—often concatenated or added—to produce the final output. This dual nature imparts bidirectional networks with their unique ability to perceive patterns considering both past and future contexts, rendering them particularly useful in tasks such as language translation, text generation, speech recognition, where understanding the full context is crucial."

    "# Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as we have explored LSTM networks, another prominent variation of RNNs that has seen widespread adoption due to its efficient handling of long-term dependencies is the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).\n",
    "\n",
    "While LSTMs effectively address the limitations of traditional RNNs by tackling the vanishing and exploding gradient problems, they come with a complex architecture that can be computationally challenging to deal with. This complexity primarily stems from the need to calculate and store three different kinds of gates (input, output, forget) at every time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reconcile this, GRUs were introduced in 2014 by Kyunghyun Cho et al. in their paper [\"Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder–Decoder for Statistical Machine Translation\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1078).\n",
    "\n",
    "The GRU architecture simplifies LSTM by merging the cell state and hidden state into a single entity known as the hidden state and employing only two types of gating units: update and reset gate. This reduction in complexity results in fewer calculations and memory requirements while maintaining competitive performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"images/gru.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 50%; height: 50%\"/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Hidden State\n",
    "\n",
    "In GRUs, there is no explicit cell state like in LSTMs. Instead, the hidden state alone stores the network's historical information from previous time steps. This economical design allows for efficient memory management and computational savings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Update Gate\n",
    "\n",
    "The update gate essentially governs how much of the past information should be kept or 'updated'. It takes the current input and previous hidden state, applies some transformations, and generates an output between zero and one. If the update gate outputs zero, the GRU disregards all past information and writes entirely new information. In contrast, if the update gate outputs one, it retains all past information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Reset Gate\n",
    "\n",
    "The reset gate is in charge of deciding how much past information is discarded before the new input is processed. Like the update gate, the reset gate accepts the current input and previous hidden state, applies some transformations, and produces an output between zero and one. A value close to zero means 'forget a significant portion of information', while a value close to one indicates 'keep most of the information'.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> GRUs have been found remarkably effective for numerous tasks such as machine translation, text generation, and speech recognition. They retain the strengths of LSTM networks in handling long-term dependencies while offering a more efficient, less computationally-intensive network architecture.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> However, the choice between LSTMs and GRUs largely depends on the specific task at hand. Some empirical studies suggest that while GRUs train faster and perform comparably to LSTMs on simpler tasks, LSTMs often have the edge on tasks that require more complex learning or longer sequence modeling."

    "We have now covered an extensive journey, exploring the foundations and insights into the world of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). We've examined the strengths and limitations of RNNs and learned how LSTMs and GRUs have significantly improved upon these foundations to better handle long-term dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these three forms of neural networks is crucial for anyone interested in Natural Language Processing (NLP). In NLP tasks, we often deal with sequenced data where understanding temporal dependencies is key, be it understanding the sentiment behind a customer review or translating a passage from one language to another. RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs offer us powerful tools to make sense of this complex, sequential data.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, remember that the choice of architecture should be dictated by the specifics of your task. While RNNs can suffice for simpler, short-term dependencies, LSTMs and GRUs are better suited for more complex tasks or longer sequences. But no model can serve as a silver bullet. Experimenting, iterating, and continuous learning are part of the process.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. RNNs process sequential data by maintaining a hidden state that captures information from previous time steps. They face challenges with vanishing and exploding gradients when dealing with long sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Vanishing gradients occur when gradients become extremely small during backpropagation, preventing effective learning. Exploding gradients happen when gradients become very large, leading to unstable training.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. LSTMs have a memory cell that maintains long-term information, and gates (input, output, forget) that regulate information flow, allowing them to capture long-term dependencies effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The input gate controls what new information is added to the cell state. The forget gate determines what information to discard from the cell state. The output gate decides what information from the cell state is used to compute the hidden state.\n",

    "6. Bidirectional LSTMs process sequences in both forward and backward directions, capturing both past and future contexts. This allows them to have a more complete understanding of the sequence.\n",
